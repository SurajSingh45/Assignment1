/*You are given an array a of n integers. Count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and aj−ai=j−I.

The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — array a.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.*/
